### GameDialogues
Custom component for game dialogues in my project. Uses Ink to work with text

### UnitTests
I was just curious about unit testing possibilities in Unity.

### EditorUtils
Useful utilities for the editor

#### FindMissingReferences
The main idea was to find missing UnityEvent references on scene. 
- Things to improve: doesn't work for overloaded methods. The script still will find it even if the inspector shows that the method is missing
